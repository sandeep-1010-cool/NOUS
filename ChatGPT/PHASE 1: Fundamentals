Great — let’s dive into **Pulumi** step-by-step. I’ll teach you in a structured, layered manner: starting from fundamentals, moving to advanced, and ending with enterprise-level practices. You don't need to ask anything — I’ll guide you continuously.

## 🧱 **PHASE 1: Fundamentals – Getting Started with Pulumi**

### 🔹 Step 1: What is Pulumi?

**Pulumi** is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that lets you **create, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure** using general-purpose programming languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, etc.).

**Example**: Instead of writing YAML in Terraform or ARM templates, you write real code like:

```python
import pulumi_aws as aws
bucket = aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket")
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Install Pulumi

1. **Install Pulumi CLI**

   * Windows:

     ```powershell
     choco install pulumi
     ```
   * Mac:

     ```bash
     brew install pulumi
     ```
   * Linux:

     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
     ```

2. **Verify Installation**

   ```bash
   pulumi version
   ```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Set up your first Pulumi project

#### 🛠️ Pre-reqs:

* Node.js or Python (we’ll use **Python** for now)
* Pulumi CLI
* An account on [https://app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com)

#### ✅ Create a new project:

```bash
mkdir pulumi-hello
cd pulumi-hello
pulumi new aws-python
```

* Select stack name (`dev`)
* Set AWS region (`us-east-1` or as needed)

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Understand Project Structure

```
.
├── __main__.py       # Infra code
├── Pulumi.yaml       # Project metadata
├── Pulumi.dev.yaml   # Stack config (like region, secrets)
├── venv/             # Python virtual environment
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Deploy Your First Resource

#### Edit `__main__.py`:

```python
import pulumi
import pulumi_aws as aws

bucket = aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket")

pulumi.export("bucket_name", bucket.id)
```

#### Deploy it:

```bash
pulumi up
```

Pulumi shows the preview. Confirm with `yes` to apply.

---

### 🔹 Step 6: View and Destroy Infrastructure

* View state:

  ```bash
  pulumi stack
  ```

* Destroy:

  ```bash
  pulumi destroy
  ```

| Concept               | You Learned                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| What is Pulumi?       | Infra as Code using real languages |
| Install Pulumi CLI    | ✅                                  |
| Create Python project | ✅                                  |
| Deploy an S3 bucket   | ✅                                  |
| Manage state & stack  | ✅                                  |

## 🔜 Coming Next: **PHASE 2 - Core Concepts & Cloud Resources**

We’ll cover:

* Stacks, Projects, State backend
* IAM, EC2, VPCs with Pulumi
* Configuration and secrets
* Using `pulumi config`
* Automation API (DevOps)

Shall I continue to Phase 2 now?
