# Creating an EKS Cluster with Pulumi

## Steps to Create an EKS Cluster

### Step 1: Installing the Pulumi EKS Library
1. Define the EKS library as a dependency in `package.json`.
2. Use the editor's auto-suggestions to select the library version.
3. Install the library using:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- The advantage of using a programming language ecosystem is the ease of accessing features like auto-suggestions for versions, function names, and attributes.

### Step 2: Creating a VPC
- Define a VPC resource using the Pulumi SDK:
  ```javascript
  const vpc = new awsx.ec2.Vpc("my-vpc", {
      cidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"
  });
  ```
- Key features:
  - **Constructor**: Simple and intuitive.
  - **Auto-suggestions**: Helps with function names and attributes.
  - **CIDR Block**: Specifies the IP address range for the VPC.

### Step 3: Creating an EKS Cluster
- Define the EKS cluster and reference the VPC:
  ```javascript
  const cluster = new awsx.eks.Cluster("my-cluster", {
      vpcId: vpc.id,
      subnetIds: vpc.subnetIds,
      instanceType: "t2.medium"
  });
  ```
- Configuration options:
  - Override defaults like CIDR block, VPC ID, subnet IDs, and instance type.
  - Referencing resources (e.g., `vpc.id`) is simple and similar to programming languages.

### Step 4: Exporting kubeconfig
- Export the kubeconfig file to connect to the cluster:
  ```javascript
  exports.kubeconfig = cluster.kubeconfig;
  ```
- This provides the necessary configuration for Kubernetes access.

### Step 5: Executing the Program
- Run the program with:
  ```bash
  pulumi up
  ```
- Features of execution:
  - **Preview**: Displays resources that will be created.
  - **Confirmation**: Requires user approval to proceed.
  - **Result**: Creates the EKS cluster in about 10 minutes.

## Pulumi Console Insights

### Resource Tab
- View all resources in your infrastructure with their prefixes to differentiate platforms and components.
- Example prefixes:
  - **AWS**: EC2, IAM.
  - **Kubernetes**: Pods, services.

### Convenient Links
- Some resources include direct links to the AWS Console for easy access.

### Graph View
- Displays connections between resources and dependencies.
- Provides a hierarchical view of components created in the background, such as:
  - VPC sub-resources.
  - EKS cluster components.

### Infrastructure History
- The Pulumi Console provides:
  - A **history of changes** to your infrastructure.
  - Details on **which team member** made changes and when.

## Cleaning Up Resources
- To delete all resources created by Pulumi, run:
  ```bash
  pulumi destroy
  ```
- This reverses the `pulumi up` execution and cleans up resources.

## Summary
Pulumi simplifies infrastructure management by leveraging programming languages for resource creation. Key benefits include:
- Declarative approach to defining infrastructure.
- Auto-suggestions and intuitive coding experience.
- Pulumi Console for history tracking and resource visualization.
- Easy cleanup with `pulumi destroy`.
