# Deleting Resources with Pulumi

Pulumi simplifies infrastructure management, including the deletion of resources, by leveraging its declarative approach and built-in commands like `pulumi destroy`. Below are the steps to delete resources and declare infrastructure states effectively.

## Declarative Deletion of Resources

### Key Concept: Declarative Infrastructure
- Pulumi operates on a **declarative model**, where you define the desired end state of your infrastructure.
- To delete resources, you simply **update your code** to reflect the new desired state (e.g., removing resource definitions).
- Pulumi automatically determines the actions required to achieve the desired state.

### Steps to Declare Resource Deletion
1. **Modify Your Code**:
    - Remove the resource definitions from your Pulumi program.
    - Example: To delete S3 buckets, remove the bucket creation code:
      ```javascript
      // Before: Code to create buckets
      const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket("my-bucket");

      // After: Remove bucket creation
      // No bucket definitions in the code
      ```

2. **Run `pulumi up`**:
    - Execute the following command:
      ```bash
      pulumi up
      ```
    - Pulumi previews the changes, showing the resources that will be deleted.
    - Confirm the changes to proceed with the deletion.

3. **Pulumi Handles State**:
    - Pulumi keeps track of the infrastructure state, so you donâ€™t need to manually specify which resources to delete.
    - It ensures that the desired end state (no buckets) is achieved.

## Using `pulumi destroy` for Complete Cleanup

### What is `pulumi destroy`?
- The `pulumi destroy` command removes **all resources** created by your Pulumi program.
- It is useful for cleaning up infrastructure when you no longer need the stack.

### Steps to Use `pulumi destroy`
1. **Navigate to Your Stack**:
    - Ensure you are in the directory containing your Pulumi stack.

2. **Execute the Command**:
    - Run:
      ```bash
      pulumi destroy
      ```
    - Pulumi previews the resources that will be destroyed.

3. **Confirm Destruction**:
    - Review the preview and confirm to proceed.
    - Pulumi removes all resources defined in the stack.

4. **Output**:
    - All resources are deleted, and the stack is cleaned up.
    - Example output:
      ```
      Destroying (dev):
      - aws:s3:Bucket my-bucket
      - aws:ec2:Vpc my-vpc
      - aws:eks:Cluster my-cluster
      Resources:
      - 3 deleted
      Duration: 45s
      ```

## Advantages of Pulumi's Deletion Approach

- **Declarative Model**:
  - Focus on defining the desired state rather than manually tracking resources.
- **State Management**:
  - Pulumi automatically handles infrastructure state, ensuring accurate and efficient deletion.
- **Ease of Cleanup**:
  - `pulumi destroy` simplifies complete cleanup when a stack is no longer needed.

## Summary
Pulumi provides two powerful methods for resource deletion:
- **Declarative Deletion**: Modify your code to reflect the desired state, and Pulumi determines the necessary actions.
- **`pulumi destroy`**: Execute this command to remove all resources in a stack.

These features make Pulumi an efficient and developer-friendly tool for infrastructure management and cleanup.
