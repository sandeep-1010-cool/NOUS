## Prerequisites
- An active AWS account.
- Administrative access to the AWS Management Console.
- Familiarity with IAM (Identity and Access Management).

## Steps to Create a User

Follow these steps to create a new user in AWS:

1. **Log In to AWS Management Console**
   - Go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console) and log in with your credentials.

2. **Navigate to IAM**
   - From the AWS services menu, select **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**.

3. **Add a New User**
   - Click on **Users** in the left sidebar.
   - Click **Add user**.
   - Enter a **User name** (e.g., `pulumi-user`).
   - Select the **Access type**:
     - Choose **Programmatic access** if you need API or CLI access.
     - Optionally, enable **AWS Management Console access** for web-based access.

4. **Set Console Access Password (Optional)**
   - If enabling console access, choose **Custom password** or **Autogenerated password**.
   - Check the box to require the user to reset their password on first login.

## Adding Permissions to the User

Assign appropriate permissions to the user based on their role and requirements:

1. **Attach Existing Policies**
   - Click **Next: Permissions**.
   - Choose **Attach existing policies directly**.
   - Use the search bar to find policies such as:
     - `AdministratorAccess` (full access to all AWS services).
     - `PowerUserAccess` (access to most services excluding IAM).
     - `AWSLambdaExecute` (specific permissions for Lambda execution).
   - Select the desired policy and click **Next**.

2. **Add Tags (Optional)**
   - Click **Next: Tags** if you want to add metadata tags to the user (e.g., department, project).

3. **Review and Create User**
   - Click **Next: Review**.
   - Verify the user details and assigned permissions.
   - Click **Create user**.

## Generating Access Keys

Access keys are required for programmatic access via AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs.

1. **Access the User Details**
   - Navigate to **Users** in the IAM dashboard.
   - Click on the newly created user.

2. **Generate Access Keys**
   - Go to the **Security credentials** tab.
   - Under **Access keys**, click **Create access key**.
   - Choose the intended use case for the key (e.g., CLI, SDK).
   - Click **Next** and confirm the creation.

3. **Save Access Key Details**
   - Note down the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.
   - Download the key file for secure storage (if available).
   - **Important**: The secret key will not be displayed again. Ensure it is saved securely.

## Notes
- Use IAM policies to grant only the necessary permissions to users.
- Regularly rotate access keys for security purposes.
- Avoid sharing access keys publicly or storing them in unencrypted locations.
