     - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   - **Linux/macOS**:
     - Use the curl command provided on the website to download and install Pulumi.
     ```bash
     curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
     ```
   - Ensure Pulumi is added to your `PATH` environment variable.

### Using Chocolatey

## Post-Installation Steps

### Login Methods
Pulumi requires you to log in before performing any operations. You can log in using one of the methods below:

#### Browser Login
- Run the following command to log in via your browser:
  ```bash
  pulumi login
  ```
- This opens the Pulumi login page in your browser. Log in using your Pulumi account credentials.

#### Local Login
- If you prefer not to use the browser, you can store credentials locally:
  ```bash
  pulumi login --local
  ```
- This stores your Pulumi credentials on your local machine.

### Create Pulumi Access Token

If you are using Pulumi in CI/CD pipelines or automated environments, you will need a Pulumi Access Token.

#### Steps to Create Pulumi Access Token
1. Log in to your Pulumi account at [https://app.pulumi.com/](https://app.pulumi.com).
2. Navigate to your **Account Settings**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top right corner.
   - Select **Account Settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. On the Account Settings page:
   - Click **Personal access tokens** from the dropdown menu under your profile icon.
4. Under the **Personal Access Tokens** section:
   - Click **Create Token**.
   - Enter a name for the token (e.g., `CI/CD Pipeline` or `Automation`).
   - Click **Create**.
5. Copy the generated token and store it securely. You will not be able to view it again.

#### Use Pulumi Access Token
- To use the token, set the `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable:
  - **Linux/macOS**:
    ```bash
    export PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```
  - **Windows**:
    ```bash
    set PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your-token>
    ```

## Test Pulumi

After installation and configuration, test Pulumi functionality:
1. Run the following command to initialize a new Pulumi project:
   ```bash
   pulumi new
   ```
2. Select a template (e.g., `aws-typescript`) to create a new project.
3. Follow the prompts to configure your project.

## Notes
- **Important**: Keep your Pulumi Access Token secure. Do not share it publicly.
- Ensure Pulumi CLI is added to your system's PATH environment variable.
- Refer to the official Pulumi documentation for troubleshooting installation issues.
