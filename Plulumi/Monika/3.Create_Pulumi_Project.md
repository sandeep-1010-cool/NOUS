3. [Setup the Stack](#setup-the-stack)

## 1. Directory Creation
Before creating a Pulumi project, set up a dedicated directory for your project.

### Steps:
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the location where you want to create your project directory.
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/your/projects
  ```
- Create a new directory for your Pulumi project:
  ```bash
  mkdir pulumi-project
  ```
- Navigate into the newly created directory:
  ```bash
  cd pulumi-project
  ```

## 2. Initialize Pulumi Project
Pulumi provides templates for various cloud providers and programming languages.

### Steps:
- Run the following command to initialize a new Pulumi project:
  ```bash
  pulumi new aws-python
  ```
- Replace `aws-python` with your desired template. Common templates include:
  - `aws-typescript`
  - `azure-python`
  - `kubernetes-go`
  - `gcp-python`

- Pulumi downloads the selected template and sets up the necessary files in your directory.

## 3. Setup the Stack
After initializing the project, Pulumi will prompt you to configure the stack.

### Steps:
- Follow the prompts to set up the stack:
  1. **Project Name**:
     - Provide a name for your project (or use the default).
  2. **Stack Name**:
     - Enter a name for your stack (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, or `prod`).
  3. **AWS Region**:
     - Specify the AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`).
  4. **Other Configuration**:
     - Pulumi may ask for additional configuration based on the template (e.g., API keys, resource names).

### Example Output:
```plaintext
Enter your project name: pulumi-project
Enter your stack name: dev
Enter AWS region: us-east-1
```

## Notes:
- After setup, Pulumi creates several files in your project directory:
  - `Pulumi.yaml`: Project configuration.
  - `Pulumi.dev.yaml`: Stack-specific configuration.
  - Code files based on the selected template.
- To deploy resources, you can use the following commands:
  ```bash
  pulumi up
  ```
- To destroy resources:
  ```bash
  pulumi destroy
  ```
- Refer to Pulumi documentation for advanced configurations and troubleshooting.
