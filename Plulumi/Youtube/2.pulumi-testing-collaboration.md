# Pulumi: Testing Infrastructure as Code and Promoting Collaboration

## Introduction
Pulumi is redefining standards in DevOps by enabling developers to treat infrastructure as code (IaC) the same way as application code. This includes testing infrastructure code and fostering collaboration between operations and development teams.

## Testing Infrastructure as Code
- **Challenges with Traditional IaC Formats**:
  - YAML, JSON, or domain-specific languages like HCL (used by Terraform) make it difficult to write tests for configuration scripts.

- **Pulumi's Advantage**:
  - Infrastructure code written in a programming language can leverage:
    - **Unit Tests** and **Integration Tests**.
    - Existing test libraries, programming languages, and editors.
  - Developers can use the same tools and practices they use for application code to test infrastructure code.

## Shift in Responsibilities and Collaboration
- Pulumi enables developers to write infrastructure as code, which was traditionally seen as a DevOps or operations team task.
- **Collaboration Benefits**:
  - **Operations Team**: Provides expertise on infrastructure specifics and required configurations.
  - **Development Team**: Brings expertise in writing efficient code, testing, and leveraging tools for managing infrastructure code.
  - This collaboration results in:
    - Efficient configuration of infrastructure.
    - Proper testing and validation of infrastructure code.
    - Better integration of infrastructure and application development processes.

## Summary
Pulumiâ€™s use of programming languages for IaC allows developers to write and test infrastructure code efficiently. This approach bridges the gap between operations and development teams, fostering collaboration and enabling both teams to contribute their expertise effectively. Pulumi is setting new standards in DevOps by integrating testing and collaboration into infrastructure management.
